## Overview

This repository is a complete demonstration of a multi‑layer school management system. It showcases how to build and connect different components of a modern .NET solution:

* Presentation Layer: An ASP.NET MVC web application providing the user interface for students, teachers, and administrators.

* Business & API Layer: A RESTful Web API exposing services and core business logic to the MVC front‑end or other clients.

* Data Access Layer (DAL): Centralized database access using Entity Framework, responsible for models, repositories, and data persistence.

* Seeder & Testing: Utilities to populate the database with sample data and to validate functionality during development.

The purpose of this project is to give a realistic example of how to design a scalable, maintainable, and testable enterprise application, covering every step from database to user interface.

## Architecture

High-level overview of the interactions:

```text
[User / Web Client]
     ↓ HTTP / Browser
[MVC_SchoolProject] ↔ [WebApi_SchoolProject]
     ↑                    ↑
     └── Data Access Layer ──┘
         (DAL handles ORM / database operations)
```

* **MVC\_SchoolProject**: manages UI and views.
* **WebApi\_SchoolProject**: provides endpoints for data operations.
* **DAL**: central data persistence and models.
* **SeederTest**: populates development/test data.

## Projects / Structure

| Project                             | Purpose                                           |
| ----------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------- |
| `DAL`                               | ORM models, database context, repository patterns |
| `MVC_SchoolProject`                 | User interface, controllers, views                |
| `WebApi_SchoolProject`              | REST API endpoints, JSON responses                |
| `SeederTest`                        | Populate the database with sample data            |
| `School_Project_Implementation.sln` | Solution file for Visual Studio                   |

---

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/MvUltimate/School_Project_Implementation.git
   ```
2. Open `School_Project_Implementation.sln` in Visual Studio or compatible IDE.
3. Configure the DAL connection string for your database.
4. Build all projects.
5. Run `SeederTest` (if applicable) to populate sample data.
6. Start the Web API project.
7. Run or debug the MVC project (which consumes the API).

---

## Requirements & Dependencies

* .NET version (e.g., .NET 6 / .NET Core / .NET Framework)
* Entity Framework or chosen ORM
* SQL Server (or other compatible database)
* Visual Studio / VS Code or other .NET IDE
* NuGet dependencies as listed in each project

---

## Usage

* Use the MVC app for user-facing interactions.
* Access the Web API via HTTP clients (Postman, curl) or AJAX from the frontend.
* Extend the DAL to support new entities or database tables.
* Run the seeder to reset or populate test data.
